- Developed a novel conditional latent diffusion pipeline by integrating a VAE-GAN for latent space compression with a DiT-3D based diffusion       transformer, enabling the generation of high-fidelity, class-specific synthetic 3D brain MRIs<br>
- Augmented the real brain MRI dataset with synthetic data, leading to substantial improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, and AUCPR for a Temporal Lobe Epilepsy classifier trained on an EfficientNet-V2 backbone.
