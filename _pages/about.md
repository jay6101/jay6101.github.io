Hello, I am Jay Sawant, a Master's student in Data Science at <a href="https://ucsd.edu">University of California, San Diego</a> and an alumnus of <a href="https://www.iitb.ac.in/">IIT Bombay</a>, where I completed a Dual Degree in Electrical Engineering (Communication and Signal Processing).
</p>

<p align="justify">
My research spans medical imaging and autonomous driving. At UCSD Health’s Lab of Cognitive Imaging, I work on deep learning for epilepsy: CNN-based methods for Temporal Lobe Epilepsy classification from MRI, conditional latent diffusion models for generating synthetic 3D T1 brain MRIs, and vision–language models that combine imaging with clinical text.
</p>

I am also interested in learning-based autonomous driving. As a Research Engineer Intern at Netradyne, I worked on imitation learning, benchmarking large camera-only and multi-modal models, scaling data for simpler architectures, and exploring temporal attention for closed-loop driving performance on benchmarks such as CARLA Leaderboard and Bench2Drive.
